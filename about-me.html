	<h2><br>My path to graphic design:</br></span></h1>
	<div class="fadein" style="animation-delay:1s">
		<p>I've been interested in graphic design since the age of <b>twelve</b> following my artistic passion of drawing as a child when I saw my family members using the Adobe Suite. With some help from my brother in setting up the apps, I self-taught myself Photoshop and Premiere Pro to handle basic image manipulation and video edits. I continued my interest in graphic design following my Creative iMedia course at high school, where I developed further skills in Photoshop. <br>My GCSE in Creative iMedia helped my chances of getting into college to pursue a two year long course in graphic design at <b>Blackpool School of Arts,</b> where I learnt how to use Illustrator, bought an iPad to utilise Procreate, and used a little bit of sweat and tears to learn InDesign. By the end of the course, I was offered a placement in an apprenticeship which would be supported by my college for an extra year, leading to where I am now.</p>

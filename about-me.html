	<h2><br>Who am I?</br></span></h1>
	<div class="fadein">
		<p>Hi! I'm Oliver, a 19 year old designer located in the North West of England. I studied graphic design for two years at Blackpool School of Arts, and have done an apprenticeship course with my college for a year. I have a strong passion for content creation, computer science and games. I daily drive a custom built desktop PC running a <b>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 TI graphics</b> card, with an <b>AMD Ryzen 9 5900X</b> processor, <b>32 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM clocked @ 3600mhz</b> and three monitors to design graphics for my clients in the workplace at peak efficiency. I like to play <b>Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V and VALORANT</b> with online friends in my spare time, assuming I'm not working on this website or polishing up my knowledge on my design applications. Following on from my computer science obsessions, I love to mod consoles such as the Nintendo Switch with custom firmware, or tinkering with other devices to put my own unique spin on them and make them feel personalised to my characteristics.</p>

	<h2><br>Why graphic design?</br></span></h1>
	<div class="fadein">
		<p>I've been interested in graphic design since the age of <b>twelve</b> following my artistic passion of drawing as a child when I saw my family members using the Adobe Suite. With some help from my brother in setting up the apps, I self-taught myself Photoshop and Premiere Pro to handle basic image manipulation and video edits. I continued my interest in graphic design following my Creative iMedia course at high school, where I developed further skills in Photoshop and learnt the ropes with file formats, the concept of client briefs, etc.. My GCSE in Creative iMedia boosted my chances of getting into college to pursue a two year long course in graphic design at <b>Blackpool School of Arts,</b> where I learnt how to use Illustrator, bought an iPad/Apple Pencil combo to utilise Procreate, and used a little bit of sweat and tears to learn InDesign. By the end of the course, I was offered a placement in an apprenticeship which would be supported by my college for an extra year, leading to where I am now.</p>

	<h2><br>What apps do you use?</br></span></h1>
	<div class="fadein">
		<p>As briefly touched upon in the last paragraph, I am most familiar with the Adobe Suite - more specifically, I am comfortable with: <b>Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, After Effects and Premiere Pro.</b> Thanks to my year-long apprenticeship, I can also efficiently navigate my way through <b>Canva</b> which is a very useful app for creating social media graphics thanks to its intuitive and lightweight UI.</p>

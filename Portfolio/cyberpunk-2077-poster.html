	<h2>Cyberpunk 2077 3D Poster</h2>
	<p>This project had quite a lengthy design process from start to finish, especially with it being my final college project, but I was fairly proud of the outcome. I illustrated the poster using Procreate, later tracing over the drafted illustration with red and yellow lines in Adobe Illustrator across three different layers. The red lines would indicate where to cut, and the yellow lines would indicate where to engrave the design into the material I am laser cutting onto. This is all thanks to the facilities made available by our college.<br><br>We exported the Illustrator file into a specific format and went into CAD software which would recognise our now-exported document full of coloured lines to get the laser cutter ready. Setting out a couple pieces of MDF wood, the laser cutter did its job in roughly an hour, and all the pieces were ready to be glued in. Lastly, we needed to print off the now-finalised illustration in A3, cut out any bleed leftover from the design, and then glue everything together, bringing us to the design we have today.</p>

	<h2>TwinkleTops Redesign</h2>
	<p>This project is one of my most recent portfolio pieces - being completed on December 20th, 2023 - and is currently one of my favourite designs that I've done yet. With lots of positive reviews and 1100 people following her Facebook store page, TwinkleTops is a United Kingdom-based cake topper designer and commissioned me privately to design them a new profile picture and banner. The original design for the client's banner was rather simplistic in design so I took the opportunity to uplift that and create a more interesting design, while also designing a logo which provides them with some extra identity aside from their name. No brand guidelines were followed since she didn't have anything for me to work off of, and wanted a ground-up redesign. The font choice was ultimately changed from a bold font to a cursive one to match the client's design choices when she is designing cake toppers for her own clients, which often use cursive fonts. I feel the font choice brings the theme of the redesign together and it received good reception from the client during the review process.</p>

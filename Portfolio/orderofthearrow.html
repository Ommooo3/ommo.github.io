	<h2>Order of the Arrow Commission</h2>
	<p>Easily my most memorable commission so far, dating all the way back to November 2021. I was contacted by an online friend who lived in New Jersey about their boy scouts club needing some new badges to go on their uniforms. This friend worked in a managerial position which is how I landed the commission, and he needed thirteen badges to be made, alongside some bear heads which I designed in Illustrator. I created the badges with a mix of Photoshop and Illustrator, though if I was to re-do this commission at any point in the future, I would make sure to do everything solely in Illustrator. Photoshop is a fantastic tool and got the job done, however getting the circular typeface along the badge would've been much easier and looked far greater if done via Illustrator, I also would've been able to export these badges in the SVG format however I still made sure to export them in a high quality resolution. I found this commission very fun due to being able to follow the company's brand guidelines, which led to them lending me one of their main fonts which would otherwise be paid for. Using the brand guidelines provided me with a challenge of utilising all the colours, fonts and rules given to me to create something new. Presenting challenge also means that my first design will not be final, of which it was not. The badges went through a lot of trial and error in the feedback process, which was especially helpful since I could take their advice into future projects. One of the main things I learnt from this commission is that you don't always have to reinvent the wheel; keeping things simple is usually best!</p>
